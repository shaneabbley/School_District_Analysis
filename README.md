# School_District_Analysis
### Overview
#### Background
Maria has asked us to clean the school districts math and reading scores data. Specifically, Maria asked us to remove data from the 9th grade students at Thomas High School, while investigations on potential academic dishonesty are carried out. After removing this data, we were asked to analyze the performance of students based on school type, funding, and size.
#### Methods
In order to accomplish this, we utilized Jupyter Notebooks and pandas to write python code that cleaned, organized, and analyzed the students testing data. 
### Analysis
#### Results
![figure 1(a)](https://github.com/shaneabbley/School_District_Analysis/Resources/Original%20District%20Summary.png)
* As seen in the images in figure 1(a) and 1(b) the effect of the removal of the scores of 9th grade students from Thomas High School had little impact on data at the district level. Slight decreases in passing percentage are observed.
* The only changes in the school summary were seen for Thomas High School. In figures 2(a) and 2(b) a slight decrease in the math score and a slight increase in the reading score is observed.
* The overall passing percentage decreased for Thomas High School; however, it is ranked 2nd regardless of the presence of the dubious data.
* Math and reading scores by grade are affected as expected, that is, there is no 9th grade data at Thomas High School.
* The scores by school spending, the scores by school size, and the scores by school type were not noticeably changed.
#### Discussion
As expected removing the aforementioned data had little impact when analyzing the data at the district level. The scores by school spending, the scores by school size, and the scores by school type were not affected when removing this data. The outlook for Thomas High School on the other hand saw decreases in performance across the board, aside from a slight increase in reading scores.
